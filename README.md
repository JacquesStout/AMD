# AMD
Main folder for AMD project 2023

Diffusion preprocessing and triaging:

SAMBA_prep_AMD.py
Goes through the relevant files from the AMD project, runs basic diffusion preprocesses and places all files in a specific folder in the format required for the running of SAMBA on the entire project line.
(For details concerning SAMBA, see https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-018-9410-0 )

Generating TRK files:

mrtrix_trk_maker.py
Once SAMBA is finished, this is the file runs the mrtrix tck generation using mrtrix based on the files created as SAMBA output.
AMD_mrtrixtrk_clusterwrapper.py
this file is the main wrapper for tck generation. It parallellizes the submission of mrtrix_trk_maker on a per subject basis.

tck2trk.py
Uses mrtrix to convert tck files to trk
AMD_wrapper_tck2trk.py
Main wrapper for converting all tck files to trk

Statistical analysis:

AMD_subj_to_MDT_clustered
Will go through the trk files and place them in the template space generated by SAMBA (MDT)
AMD_subj_to_MDT_clusterwrapper.py
Clusters on a per subject basis the trk_MDT generation seen above

streamline_average_prep_AMD_clustered.py
This file iterates through all MDT trk files previously generated and creates the grouping and connectome files.
streamline_average_prep_clusterwrapper.py
Wrapper for the connectome+grouping generation

streamline_average_AMD.py
Using the grouping files established previously, streamline average combines the tracts of all subjects on a per Connection basis, as well as write multiple trackers for the correspondence of streamline fa information and other statistics

streamline_bundle_stats_AMD.py
Uses the sum of trk results of streamline_average_AMD and splits them into different bundles, then generates the statistical files used for analysis

streamline_bundle_view_AMD.py
Allows for the viewing of specific bundles, streamlines, etc based on the results of streamline_bundle_stats_AMD.py (good for figure generation and quality control)
